Version: 1.1.2
Description: Load the Just Another Gibbs Sampling (JAGS) module 'pexm'. The module provides the tools to work with the Piecewise Exponential (PE) distribution in a Bayesian model with the corresponding Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm (Gibbs Sampling) implemented via JAGS. Details about the module implementation can be found in Mayrink et al. (2021) <doi:10.18637/jss.v100.i08>.
